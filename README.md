# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Marketing Task Management System

This is a task management system tailored for the marketing team at our fast-growing startup. The system allows team leads to assign tasks to team members, view all available tasks, update task statuses, filter tasks by status or assigned team member, and delete specific tasks when necessary.

## Assumptions

1. **User Authentication:** 
   - Assumed that user authentication will be implemented separately using a third-party service like Auth0 or Firebase Authentication.

2. **User Roles:**
   - Assumed that there are two user roles: team leads and team members. Team leads have additional privileges like assigning tasks and deleting tasks.

3. **Task Model:**
   - Assumed that the task model includes fields such as title, description, status, assigned user, and creation date.

4. **Filtering Options:**
   - Assumed that filtering options include filtering by task status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed) and by assigned team member.

## Instructions for Running Locally

### Backend (Python Flask)

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd backend

arduino
Copy code

2. Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # For Unix/Linux

markdown
Copy code

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown
Copy code

4. Set up the database:
- Modify `config.py` to specify your database connection settings.
- Run migrations to create database tables:
  ```
  flask db init
  flask db migrate
  flask db upgrade
  ```

5. Run the Flask app:
flask run

markdown
Copy code

6. The Flask app should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

### Frontend (React.js)

1. In a separate terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
cd frontend

markdown
Copy code

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

markdown
Copy code

3. Start the React app:
npm start

csharp
Copy code

4. The React app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

### Accessing the Application

- Access the application by opening http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
- Ensure that the backend server is running locally on http://localhost:5000 to handle API requests.

## Additional Notes

- User authentication and authorization are not implemented in this demo. Consider integrating a third-party authentication service for production use.
- Error handling and data validation are simplified for demonstration purposes. Implement more robust error handling and validation in a production environment.
- Make sure to secure sensitive information such as database credentials and API keys before deploying the application to production.
Make sure to replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository containing the code for the web application. This README.md provides clear instructions on how to set up and run the application locally, along with assumptions made during the development process.
